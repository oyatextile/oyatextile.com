		<h2 id="db8bcb04-d861-4de2-9ff4-a20047cbbf4e" class="">What are waffle towels made from?</h2>
		<p id="d5d20c2d-9046-493b-aa93-aff475db1130" class="">Waffle towels are made from either cotton or microfibre,
			which is woven on a loom. which makes waffle towels more long-lasting than chemically produced towels.
			Bath robes and waffle towels that are used in the bathroom from cotton to create ultra softness whilst
			drying. As kitchen waffle towels are mainly used for cleaning and drying, microfibre is a more popular
			choice than cotton.</p>
		<h2 id="d61f2022-9542-432d-b357-55f86bfca4ef" class="">Are waffle towels more absorbent?</h2>
		<p id="00fcb463-ffc2-448b-a19c-762f910a3387" class="">Thereâ€™s no arguing waffle towels looks fresh and modern,
			yet the waffle design makes them great for bathrooms, too. The honeycomb pockets draw moisture off the
			surface and into the base layer, making them way hyper absorbent than traditional terry cloth towels which
			just kind of push moisture around. And since there is actually more surface area on a waffle towel (again
			due to the honeycomb pocket design), they dry faster than a plush towel.</p>
		<p id="6f29ca2f-ecc8-4100-a99c-e75b8840b28d" class="">Waffle towels, in contrast, dry within one or two hours.,
			waffle towels take up way less storage space than their bulky terry counterparts due to their flat-weave
			structure.</p>
